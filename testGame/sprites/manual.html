<h1>How to use these materials</h1>
<p>
Images included in the 'ex_characters' folder are additional materials not included in the standard materials.<br />
Here, we will introduce how to use these materials.

<section>
<h2>Base parts</h2>

<p>
It is a body used for soldiers, maids, and students.<br />
Compared to normal characters such as Actor, the eyes are simpler.
</p>
<p>
The top is an adult male and the bottom is an adult female.<br />
On the upper right, the tall man's hair is used by shifting it slightly upward.<br />
Such processing is possible with any graphic tool that has a layer function.

<h2>Soldier</h2>
<figure>
<img src="ex_characters/Soldier.png" width="576" height="576" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
'Soldier.png' is a soldier with a helmet. Is not in standard resource. <br />
This armor is based on the red armor in 7 of 'People3.png' and he is made in the color 8, so I think it is easy to use as a soldier of the same country. <br />
The helmet is based on the one included in the tileset.<br />
'SoldierCV1.png' is a version of 8 of 'People3.png' made with a mob face, a female soldier added, and divided into four colors.<br />
'SoldierCV2.png' has a different hair color than 'SoldierCV1.png'.<br />
'SoldierCV3.png' is 'SoldierCV1.png' with the head changed to a helmet.<br />
'DamageSoldier.png' is an assortment of more soldier damage graphics.
</p>
<p>
'SoldierArmor.png' is the armor piece and 'SoldierCape.png' is the cloak.<br />
'SoldierParts.png' is a hat and a surcoat worn on top of armor.The bottom part is a part with only the color part separated, and by changing the color tone and layering it on the top part, you can create a soldier in a color other than the four colors that have already been combined. can be made.<br />
'DamageSoldierParts.png' is a part for damage graphics.<br />
Such processing is possible with any graphic tool that has a layer function.

<h2>Others</h2>
<p>
'Monster2.png' and 'Monster2_Damage.png' were newly created by selecting 8 monsters from monsters that have battle images but no top-view graphics.<br />
'ex1.png', 'ex2.png', 'SF_ex1.png', 'SF_ex2.png' are mainly materials for hats and glasses.<br />
'$Demon.png' is 8 of 'Monster.png' newly produced as a top-view graphic of a medium-sized monster.<br />
'$People2_1.png' is a bald version of 1 of 'People2.png'. Why did they make something like this? It's a mystery.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Faces</h2>
<figure>
<img src="faces/SF_People2.png" width="576" height="288" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>
'SF_People2.png' didn't have a face graphic, so I randomly drew a face.<br />
'ScoolActor1.png', 'ScoolActor2.png', and 'ScoolActor3.png' are the face graphics of the school uniform version of the Actor.<br />
Please use it because it is in the 'faces' folder.
</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Doors</h2>
<p>
The scale of the other furniture is roughly the same, but the standard square door is the size that you have to squat down to pass through, so I made a door that fits the three-headed character.<br />
Please use it because it is in the 'doors' folder.
